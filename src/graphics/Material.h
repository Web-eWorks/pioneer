	 * Materials contain all the needed information to take some triangles
	 * (or points, or lines) and get colored pixels on screen. They come with
	 * some basic state common to all materials, and any additional state is
	 * defined in <.shaderdef> files found in the data/shaders/<API> directory.
	 *
	 * Material state comes in three main types:
	 *
	 * - Push Constants are simple typed values set every time this material
	 *   is used to draw something. The underlying renderer API may have
	 *   constraints on how many push constants can be used in a single
	 *   material, so they're a good candidate for indexes into a buffer or
	 *   texture array, but not for passing large amounts of data. Expect
	 *   a worst-case maximum size of 64 bytes (1 matrix4x4f).
	 *
	 * - Textures are, like the name implies, images of any sort and size.
	 *   You can only bind a texture to a slot that has the same underlying
	 *   texture type (e.g. Texture2D, Cubemap), and it is the calling code's
	 *   responsibility to keep the texture alive until the renderer is done
	 *   using it (more on that later).
	 *
	 * - Buffers are chunks of data passed from the calling code to the shader
	 *   program running on the GPU. The structure of the buffer is determined
	 *   by agreement between the calling code and the shader; no translation
	 *   is performed by the Material system.
	 *   Buffers are allocated in increments of 256 bytes, so if you only have
	 *   one or two vectors to send to the shader, please use Push Constants
	 *   instead. Trust me, your framerate will thank you.
	 *   It is the calling code's responsibility to ensure that buffers set
	 *   with BUFFER_USAGE_DYNAMIC are set *at least* once per frame; failing
	 *   to observe this will cause the shader to be sent undefined data.
	 *
	 * Now that you know about state, let's talk about ownership.
	 *
	 * Push Constants are easy. Once you set them on a material, they stay and
	 * are used for every draw until you change them again.
	 *
	 * Once you set a texture on a material and draw, it is the calling code's
	 * responsibility to ensure that texture stays alive until the end of the
	 * frame, even if you then set another texture on the material.
	 * Most textures are acquired from the TextureCache and thus this isn't a
	 * problem. If you're doing something special that doesn't involve the
	 * TexCache, stop yourself and ask why; then remember to keep the texture
	 * alive until the next SwapBuffers().
	 *
	 * Buffer objects are simpler - if you SetBuffer(..., BUFFER_USAGE_DYNAMIC)
	 * then that buffer binding will stay there until the end of the frame.
	 * However, once SwapBuffers() is called, all dynamic buffers are rendered
	 * INVALID and must be re-set. Failure to do so will cause the shader to
	 * read garbage data the next time you draw.
	 * Setting a static buffer is easy, but once you draw using the material,
	 * you must not call SetBuffer() until the next SwapBuffers().
	 *
	 * If you delete (or cause to be deleted by decrementing ref counts) a
	 * Texture or (TDB: Buffer object), it is your responsibility to set
	 * the Texture or (TBD: Buffer) reference to <nullptr>. Failure to do so
	 * will result in undefined behavior.
